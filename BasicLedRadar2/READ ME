🔧 Arduino Radar Sensor Project
This project simulates a basic scanning radar system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor mounted on a servo motor, paired with three LEDs to indicate object proximity at different angles. It’s a great demonstration of servo control, distance sensing, and analog output in Arduino.

🛠️ Hardware Overview
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno (or compatible)

Distance Sensor: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

Servo Motor: Standard hobby servo

LEDs: 3 (representing left, center, and right zones)

Custom Part: 3D-printed open-top plastic box mounted on the servo to hold the ultrasonic sensor

The ultrasonic sensor is mounted inside a small 3D-printed enclosure, which is attached to the horn of a servo motor. As the servo sweeps from 0° to 180°, the sensor scans the environment. Depending on the detected distance, corresponding LEDs light up to indicate how close an object is in that direction.

⚙️ Code Functionality
The program performs the following steps:

Initialization:

Attaches the servo to pin 2.

Sets pin modes for the left (D5), forward (D6), and right (D11) LEDs.

Initializes the ultrasonic sensor using the NewPing library.

Scanning Logic:

The servo motor sweeps from 0° to 180° in three segments:

0°–60°: Left zone → Controls the left LED

61°–120°: Center zone → Controls the forward LED

121°–180°: Right zone → Controls the right LED

At each angle, the ultrasonic sensor takes a distance reading.

The brightness of each LED is adjusted using analogWrite() based on how close an object is. Closer objects result in brighter LEDs.

Distance Mapping:

Readings are mapped from 0–20 cm to LED brightness levels (0–255).

If no object is detected (ping_cm() == 0), the LED is turned off.
